## Project Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   Fork this repository or clone it directly:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gourab9817/ByteCode.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**  
   Navigate to the project directory and install all dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure Data Paths**  
   - The `ByteCode` directory contains all data files, training and testing scripts, and Flask applications.
   - Update the path for `dataset.csv` in your code to match your local directory structure.

## Usage Instructions

### Running the Main Prediction Model

1. **Navigate to the `flask_app` Directory**  
   Change to the main Flask app directory:
   ```bash
   cd ByteCode/flask_app
   ```

2. **Start the Flask Application**  
   Run the following command to start the main Flask application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
   This will launch a server and display a route link in the terminal. Copy and paste this link into your web browser to access the application.

3. **Using the Web Interface**  
   - On the provided route link, you can enter values to get predictions from the trained LSTM model.

### Running the Crop Recommendation Module

1. **Open a New Terminal**  
   To start the crop recommendation module, open a new terminal window.

2. **Navigate to the Crop Recommendation Directory**  
   Change to the `crop_recommendation` directory:
   ```bash
   cd ByteCode/crop_recommendation
   ```

3. **Start the Crop Recommendation Script**  
   Run the crop recommendation module:
   ```bash
   python crop_recommendation.py
   ```
   This module will also provide a route link. Use this link to access the crop recommendation web interface, where you can enter values for crop prediction and view results.

## Technical Overview

- **Main Application (`flask_app`)**: Hosts the primary prediction model and web interface.
- **Models**: Utilizes an LSTM model trained on datasets in the `ByteCode` directory.
- **Crop Recommendation Module**: Provides crop-specific predictions based on various user inputs.
